## 0.8.10

- Fixed Python serverless transforms failing on Windows. The local subprocess backend hardcoded `python3`, which the python.org Windows installer does not put on PATH (it installs `python` and the `py` launcher), so every Python transform raised "interpreter not available". The interpreter is now resolved from a per-language list of command candidates (`python3`, then `python`, then the `py` launcher) using a cross-platform PATH lookup, leaving POSIX behavior unchanged. (#116)

## 0.8.9

- Fixed `trmnlp serve` binding to localhost under Podman, which left the dev server unreachable through published ports. Container detection only looked for `/.dockerenv`, which Docker writes but Podman does not, so `serve` fell back to `127.0.0.1`. It now also checks for `/run/.containerenv`, which Podman writes, so the automatic `0.0.0.0` bind works for both runtimes. (#112)

## 0.8.8

- Added a `--server` flag to `trmnlp login` so commands like `trmnlp push` can target a self-hosted (BYOS) server. The chosen URL is saved as `base_url`, and the `user_` API key prefix is only required for trmnl.com; BYOS servers accept their own token formats. A scheme-less `--server` value (such as `localhost:3000`) no longer crashes the host check. (#113)
- `trmnlp list` now shows plugins with a nil `plugin_id`, which BYOS servers like LaraPaper return. (#113)

## 0.8.7

- Fixed `.trmnlp.yml` `variables` overrides under the `trmnl` namespace being dropped. The assembler re-applied the pre-override namespace after the transform, clobbering user overrides like `trmnl.user.time_zone`. (#110)
- Fixed the transform receiving the `trmnl.system` namespace, which the hosted service withholds. Transforms now see only `trmnl.user`, `trmnl.device`, and `trmnl.plugin_settings`, matching production.
- Added `trmnl.user.id` to the user namespace so its shape matches the hosted service.

## 0.8.6

- Fix missing form fields `db/data/form_fields.yml`.

## 0.8.5

- Fixed `pluralize`, `number_with_delimiter`, and `number_to_currency` Liquid filters raising `Liquid error: internal`. `trmnl-liquid` 0.7 moved `RailsHelpers` behind an opt-in `load(:rails)`, but the filters still probed `RailsHelpers.respond_to?` against the now-undefined constant. Stubbing an empty module makes the probe return false so the bundled fallback implementations run. (#105)

## 0.8.4

- Fixed `trmnlp serve` hanging after switching between browser tabs. Live reload now uses `rack.hijack` so SSE connections release their Puma worker thread immediately instead of holding it for the lifetime of the tab.
- Fixed Ctrl-C requiring three presses to stop the dev server. filewatcher 3.0.1 was clobbering Puma's signal handlers with its own `trap('INT') { exit }`.
- Fixed scaffolded plugins silently skipping their transform when `settings.yml` had `serverless_language: ''`. The empty string was treated as truthy in Ruby and short-circuited the file-extension fallback.
- Docker examples in the README now use `--pull always` (and `pull_policy: always` for Compose) so a new release is picked up on the next `docker run` without a manual pull.

## 0.8.3

- `trmnlp init` and `trmnlp clone` now scaffold a `.github/workflows/trmnl.yml` CI workflow and a `.gitignore`, and run `git init -b main`, so a cloned plugin is ready to push to GitHub and deploy on every commit to `main`
- Added `--skip-git` to `trmnlp init` and `trmnlp clone` for projects that manage Git themselves
- The Docker image now ships `git` so the `docker run trmnl/trmnlp clone` flow leaves a ready-to-push project on the host
- View templates now ship canonical `layout` + `title_bar` markup that passes `trmnlp lint`

## 0.8.2

- Fixed `framework_version: latest` rendering against the auto-upgrading `/latest/` asset path instead of the current concrete release, matching the hosted service (#99)
- Cleanup and minor improvements

## 0.8.1

### Added

- `trmnlp build --png` renders a PNG for every view alongside the HTML, with `--width`, `--height`, and `--color-depth` flags to override the defaults (#92)
- Colour-coded the preview's payload-size badge — yellow from 75 KB, red from 100 KB — so an oversized merge-variable payload is visible at a glance (#67)
- Added colour to CLI output — `lint` results, warnings, and errors — suppressed automatically when output is piped or redirected (#33)

### Fixed

- `trmnlp init` no longer produces read-only project files when trmnlp itself is installed read-only, such as on NixOS (#83)
- Non-JSON polling responses (`text/html`, `text/plain`) are exposed to templates as `{{ data }}`, matching the hosted service — previously `{{ text }}` (#81)

### Housekeeping

- Added SimpleCov coverage tracking, gated in CI at a 90% floor, plus dedicated specs for every lint check
- Extracted the headless-Firefox driver into a shared `FirefoxDriver` module used by both `serve` and `build --png`

## 0.8.0

### Housekeeping

- Upgraded the development, CI, and Docker baseline to Ruby 4.0.4
- Replaced the faye-websocket live reload with server-sent events, removing the eventmachine dependency
- Upgraded `filewatcher` to 3.x for Ruby 4.0 support
- Upgraded `mini_magick` to 5.x (ImageMagick 7 only)
- Upgraded `rubyzip` to 3.x
- Upgraded `puma` to 8.x
- Upgraded `oj` and `selenium-webdriver` to their latest releases
- Upgraded `trmnl-liquid` to 0.7 and `xdg` to 10
- Added the `cgi` gem, removed from Ruby's standard library in 4.0
- Dropped the redundant `pathname` gem dependency; Ruby provides `Pathname` built in
- Added `.rspec` configuration and a `Rakefile`

### Refactor

- Refactored screen generation into focused objects: `Screen`, `Screenshot`, `Renderer`, `ImageQuantizer`, `BrowserPool`, `Reporter`, `Watcher`, `Poller`, `UserDataAssembler`
- Added support for `text/html` and `text/plain` polling responses with JSON body sniffing (#81)
- Fixed Liquid conditionals (`{% if %}...{% endif %}`) spanning `polling_headers` values (#79)
- Fixed multi-select custom_fields being coerced into JSON strings — arrays now preserved (#80)
- Fixed `trmnl.device.{width,height}` in user-data so they reflect the picker's selected model (#94)
- Fixed `Permission denied` from `trmnlp clone` on Linux when overwriting template files (#83)
- Fixed deprecated `convert` warning by switching to mini_magick's `Magick` tool (#89)

### Serverless Transforms

- Added `transform_runtime:` config in `.trmnlp.yml` — serverless transforms are enabled by default and run whenever a `src/transform.*` file is present; set to `disabled` to turn them off
- Added `serverless_daemon_url:` override for pointing at a remote transform daemon (production-fidelity testing, shared team daemons)
- Added `serverless_language:` override (`python`, `ruby`, `php`, `node`)
- Added detection of `src/transform.{py,rb,php,js}` with language inferred from extension
- Added `TRMNLP::TransformClient` strategy host that selects `TransformBackend::Subprocess` (default) or `TransformBackend::Http` (when `serverless_daemon_url` is set) via `.from_config`
- Added `TRMNLP::TransformBackend::Subprocess` — local subprocess execution mirroring the hosted serverless wrapper contract verbatim, output flows back via a per-execution tempfile
- Added `python3`, `nodejs`, and `php-cli` to the main `Dockerfile`'s runtime stage alongside the existing `ruby` so all four supported transform languages work out of the box — no sidecar required
- Added transform-error surfacing in the preview UI when execution fails
- Added filewatcher re-poll when transform source changes (hot reload)
- Added `examples/hn-stories/` — a complete worked example fetching Hacker News top stories and rendering across all four sizes

### Framework Picker

- Added `framework_version:` plugin setting in `src/settings.yml` (defaults to `latest`, supports pinning to any released version) — round-trips through `trmnlp push`/`pull` alongside the hosted plugin archive format
- Added `framework_asset_host:` override in `.trmnlp.yml` for offline / mirrored development
- Added `TRMNLP::FrameworkVersion` mirroring the hosted framework versioning
- Added `rake framework:sync` to refresh `db/data/framework_versions.yml` from a local design-system checkout
- Updated `render_html.erb` to derive CSS/JS URLs from the resolved framework version

### FormField & Init Template

- Added FormField schema vendored from the hosted service (`db/data/form_fields.yml`) covering the full field-type allowlist
- Refreshed the `trmnlp init` template to scaffold `framework_version` and transform configuration, including a `transform.py.example`
- Fixed non-portable `/bin/bash` shebang in the generated `bin/trmnlp` (#78)

### Plugin Migration Strategy

The plugin directory structure has changed to better align with the [plugin archive format](https://help.trmnl.com/en/articles/10542599-importing-and-exporting-private-plugins#h_581fb988f0). 

Here is a migration strategy for existing plugin repositories:

1. Create `.trmnlp.yml` and bring over preview settings from `config.toml` - [see README](README.md)
2. Rename directory `views/` to `src/`
3. Create `src/settings.yml` and bring over plugin settings from `config.toml` - [see TRMNL docs](https://help.trmnl.com/en/articles/10542599-importing-and-exporting-private-plugins#h_581fb988f0)
4. Delete `config.toml`
